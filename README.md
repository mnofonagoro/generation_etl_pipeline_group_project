# Values Alignment 

## How are we going to balance rest with work?
-	Finish at a certain time – cut off time for work is 5.30pm 
-	Although some people work at different times of day – also people work at different speeds
-	Everyone should feel free to say if they’re fatigued 
-	There’s going to be overtime but not let it happen too often
-	Avoid work on weekends – but sometimes unavoidable  
-	depends on person
-	respect others obligations

## How are you going to support yourself and each other?
-	Talking, being honest with how you’re feeling, daily check-ins, regular check ins 
-	Cultivate an environment where you can express yourself, don’t shame others for being behind work

## How are you going to challenge yourself and each other?
-	Ask questions, ask each other about why we did something a certain way, (whether at a certain part or at the end of the week)
-	Learning something new, doing something that makes you uncomfortable

## How are you going to apply yourselves to the work, what professional standards will you uphold?
-	We don’t have a choice 
-	Apply yourself- don’t procrastinate, don’t waste too much time
-	Set yourself a time limit- if you don’t get something done with a certain time period, you should ask for help
-	Dedicating yourself to best practises for both work and self-care

## How are you going to decide who works on what?
-	Democracy 
-	Paired programming 
-	When it’s a big task or issue – then we can split the tasks up – otherwise individual working
-	When its task delegation: volunteering, varied work difficulties for each person, see what everyone’s comfortable with. Give 1-5 difficulty levels and if someone has a 5 then try not to give the ticket to them.
-	Perhaps more than one person works on the same ticket – 
-	Sometimes group decision – also if one person is working on architecture then present it to the group then we make a decision as a team.
-	Weekly retros: give each person a chance to explain what they did- good practise for the future. Both for asking and answering questions. 

## How are you going to deal with conflict? 	
-	Be straight forward – voice your opinion / concern respectfully 
-	Don’t instigate 
-	Talk everything out
